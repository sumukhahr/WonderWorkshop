Wonder workshop problem solution

I have already created a text file named fruits.txt which has the fruits and thier count. It also contains the duplicate elements. 

I have a "TestProgram.py" file which should run on any platform which has Python installed on it. 

Download the ".zip" file and run any IDE with Python
